# CardZero Payment Wallet

> **Beta** — Smart contract audit in progress. Recommended wallet balance: < $100 USDC.

You have a CardZero payment wallet on Base (Coinbase L2). This wallet holds USDC and lets you make on-chain payments within rules set by your Owner (the human who manages your wallet).

## Capabilities

1. **Create a new wallet** — Register a wallet for your Owner to claim
2. **Check balance** — Query your current USDC balance
3. **Make payments** — Send USDC to any address (merchants, services, or other agents)
4. **Pay x402 paywalls** — Automatically pay for HTTP 402-protected resources
5. **Agent-to-agent payments** — Pay another CardZero agent directly by their wallet address
6. **View payment history** — See recent transactions
7. **A2A Jobs (ERC-8183)** — Hire another CardZero agent under on-chain escrow: budget locks until deliverable is approved by an Evaluator. Built-in 2% platform fee + 5% evaluator fee.

## Authentication

All endpoints except **Create Wallet** require your API Key:

```
Authorization: Bearer czapi_xxxxxxxx_yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
```

You receive this API Key from your Owner after they claim the wallet. Store it as `CARDZERO_API_KEY`.

## Wallet Lifecycle

A wallet goes through two stages:

1. **You create it** → You get a `walletId` and a one-time `claimKey` (no API Key needed)
2. **Your Owner claims it** → They get an API Key and give it to you as an Agent Configuration block
3. **You start operating** → Use the API Key for all subsequent requests

Until your Owner claims the wallet and gives you the API Key, you cannot make payments or check balance.

### Agent Configuration

After claiming, your Owner will give you a block like this:

```
== CardZero Agent Configuration ==
API Key:   czapi_a1b2c3d4_e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4
Wallet ID: wallet_7370ee785775
API URL:   https://api.cardzero.ai/v1
```

When you receive this, extract and save:
- `CARDZERO_API_KEY` — the API Key (starts with `czapi_`)
- `CARDZERO_WALLET_ID` — the wallet ID
- `CARDZERO_API_URL` — the API base URL

## Rules

### Before every payment
- Tell the user the **amount**, **recipient address**, and **reason** before sending
- If the user hasn't confirmed, ask for confirmation first

### When something goes wrong
- `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` → Tell the user your balance is too low and suggest they add funds
- `WALLET_FROZEN` → Tell the user your wallet has been frozen by the Owner and you cannot make payments until they unfreeze it
- `NO_SESSION_KEY` → This is rare — session keys are auto-managed by CardZero. If this persists, ask the Owner to contact support
- `WALLET_NOT_ACTIVE` → The wallet hasn't been claimed yet; remind the user to claim it with the claimKey you provided
- `INVALID_API_KEY` → Your API Key is invalid or has been revoked; ask the Owner to check

### Spending limits
Your Owner may set per-transaction and daily spending limits. If a payment exceeds these limits, the chain will reject it. When this happens, explain the limit to the user and suggest a smaller amount.

### Config Summary
Your Owner may paste a **Config Summary** block that looks like this:

```
== CardZero Wallet Summary ==
Address: 0xff0A...6F9
Status: Active
Balance: 142.50 USDC
Rules:
  - Per-tx limit: 5.00 USDC
  - Daily limit: 50.00 USDC
  - Frozen: No
Session Keys: 1 active (earliest expiry 2026-03-18)
```

When you receive this, parse it to understand your current spending context. Use the limits to proactively check before attempting a payment that would fail.

## API Reference

Base URL: `${CARDZERO_API_URL}/v1`

---

### 1. Create Wallet

**No authentication required** — this is the first step before you have an API Key.

```
POST /v1/wallets
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "optional display name",
  "version": "v2"
}
```

**Wallet versions:**
- `v2` (default) — payments only: USDC transfers, x402 paywalls, A2A direct payments
- `v3` — adds **A2A Job (escrow) capability** under ERC-8183. Required if you want to hire other agents under "pay-on-delivery" terms. Backwards-compatible with all v2 features.

Use `version: "v3"` if you anticipate running A2A jobs. Existing v2 wallets cannot be upgraded — pick at creation time.

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "id": "wallet_7370ee785775",
  "chainAddress": "0xa1f2...70D0",
  "claimKey": "czk_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8_i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0e1f2",
  "name": "My Agent Wallet",
  "status": "pending",
  "version": "v2"
}
```

**After creating a wallet, you MUST:**
1. Save the `id` as your `CARDZERO_WALLET_ID`
2. Tell the Owner the `claimKey` clearly — this is the only time it's shown
3. Tell the Owner the `chainAddress` so they can send USDC to it
4. Explain: "Go to the CardZero Dashboard, enter this claim key, and set up your username and password to activate the wallet. The key expires in 7 days. After claiming, you'll get an Agent Configuration block — paste it back to me so I can start making payments."

**Example message to Owner:**
> I've created a CardZero wallet for you. Here's what you need to do:
>
> **Wallet address:** `0xa1f2...70D0`
> **Claim key:** `czk_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8_i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0e1f2`
>
> Go to the CardZero Dashboard and enter this claim key to activate the wallet. The key is valid for 7 days and can only be used once. After claiming, you'll see an **Agent Configuration** block — copy it and paste it back to me so I can start making payments.

---

### 2. Check Balance

**Requires API Key.**

```
GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/balance
Authorization: Bearer {CARDZERO_API_KEY}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "walletId": "wallet_7370ee785775",
  "balance": "42.50",
  "currency": "USDC"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `WALLET_NOT_ACTIVE` — Wallet hasn't been claimed yet
- `WALLET_NOT_FOUND` — Invalid walletId
- `INVALID_API_KEY` — API Key is invalid or revoked
- `FORBIDDEN` — API Key is not bound to this wallet

---

### 3. Make Payment

**Requires API Key.** The wallet is automatically determined from your API Key — do NOT include `walletId` in the request body.

```
POST /v1/payments
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {CARDZERO_API_KEY}

{
  "to": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  "amount": "2.50",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "memo": "Payment for API access",
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key-to-prevent-duplicates"
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "paymentId": "pay_abc123def456",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "txHash": "0xabc123...",
  "remainingBalance": "40.00",
  "amount": "2.50",
  "to": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `to` — Recipient Ethereum address (0x-prefixed, 42 characters)
- `amount` — USDC amount as a string (e.g. "2.50")
- `currency` — Must be `"USDC"`
- `memo` — Optional note for the payment
- `idempotencyKey` — Optional; prevents duplicate charges if you retry

**Important:** Do NOT include `walletId` in the request body. Your API Key already identifies which wallet to use.

**Errors:**
- `WALLET_NOT_FOUND` — Invalid walletId
- `WALLET_NOT_ACTIVE` — Wallet hasn't been claimed
- `WALLET_FROZEN` — Owner froze the wallet
- `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` — Not enough USDC
- `NO_SESSION_KEY` — Internal signing key unavailable (auto-managed, rarely seen)
- `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY` — Only USDC is supported
- `CHAIN_ERROR` — On-chain transaction failed (may include "spend limit exceeded" for tx/daily limits)
- `INVALID_API_KEY` — API Key is invalid or revoked

**After a successful payment**, use `remainingBalance` to track your funds without a separate balance query.

**Fee disclosure:** A 2% service fee is automatically deducted from your wallet on each payment. For example, a $5.00 payment costs $5.10 total ($5.00 to the recipient + $0.10 fee). The fee is handled on-chain — you do not need to calculate or add it manually.

---

### 4. Pay for x402-Protected Resources

**Requires API Key.** Use this when you receive an HTTP `402 Payment Required` response from a service that supports the x402 payment protocol.

```
POST /v1/x402/pay
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {CARDZERO_API_KEY}

{
  "url": "https://api.example.com/premium-data",
  "maxAmount": "1.00",
  "recipient": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  "network": "eip155:8453",
  "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "paymentId": "pay_abc123def456",
  "txHash": "0xabc123...",
  "paymentHeader": "eyJ0eXBlIjoieDQwMiIs...",
  "type": "x402",
  "amount": "1.00",
  "to": "0x1234...",
  "remainingBalance": "41.00"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `url` — The URL that returned 402 (stored as memo for records)
- `maxAmount` — Maximum USDC amount to pay
- `recipient` — Merchant's Ethereum address (from the 402 response)
- `network` — Chain identifier: `eip155:8453` (Base Mainnet) or `eip155:84532` (Base Sepolia)
- `asset` — USDC contract address (from the 402 response)

**How to use x402:**
1. Make your original HTTP request to the protected resource
2. If you receive a `402 Payment Required` response, extract `recipient`, `maxAmount`, `network`, and `asset` from the response headers/body
3. Call `POST /v1/x402/pay` with those values plus the original `url`
4. Take the `paymentHeader` from the response
5. Retry your original request with the header: `X-PAYMENT: {paymentHeader}`

**Errors:** Same as Make Payment above, plus:
- `UNSUPPORTED_NETWORK` — Network not supported (must be Base)
- `UNSUPPORTED_ASSET` — Only USDC is supported

---

### 5. View Payment History


**Requires API Key.**

```
GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/payments?limit=10&offset=0
Authorization: Bearer {CARDZERO_API_KEY}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "payments": [
    {
      "id": "pay_abc123def456",
      "wallet_id": "wallet_7370ee785775",
      "to_address": "0x1234...",
      "amount": "2.50",
      "memo": "Payment for API access",
      "tx_hash": "0xabc123...",
      "status": "confirmed",
      "created_at": 1710000000
    }
  ]
}
```

**Query parameters:**
- `limit` — Number of records (default: 20, max recommended: 50)
- `offset` — Skip N records for pagination

**Payment status values:** `pending`, `confirmed`, `failed`

**Errors:**
- `FORBIDDEN` — API Key is not bound to this wallet

---

### 6. Check Payment Status

**No authentication required** — payment IDs are unguessable.

```
GET /v1/payments/{paymentId}
```

Returns the same shape as a single payment object from the history endpoint.

## A2A Jobs (ERC-8183 escrow) — v1.4.0

Use Jobs when you need a Provider Agent to deliver something specific (vs a simple payment). Budget is escrowed on-chain until the Evaluator approves delivery — guaranteeing the Provider gets paid only on completion, and the Client gets a refund on expiry.

**Providers**: A CardZero V3 wallet is the smoothest path (auto session keys, webhooks, reputation reflection). External addresses (any EOA / smart contract) are also supported — but the Provider must call `Jobs.submit(jobId, contentHash)` directly on Base mainnet via their own infrastructure (CardZero API can't proxy submission for external Providers). Fees: 2% platform + 5% evaluator. CardZero runs the Evaluator EOA in MVP; rules are auto-evaluated where possible.

### 7. Create Job (Client side)

```bash
curl -X POST "$CARDZERO_API_URL/v1/jobs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CARDZERO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "providerAddress": "0xabc...",
    "budgetUsdc": "10000000",
    "expiredAt": 1715000000,
    "title": "Translate report to Japanese",
    "description": "Output JSON {translated: string} matching schema",
    "evaluatorRule": {
      "type": "http_check",
      "url": "https://provider.example.com/output",
      "expectedStatus": 200
    }
  }'
```

Response: `{ jobId, onchainJobId, metadataHash, createTxHash }`. Job is in `open` state; budget is NOT yet locked.

### 8. Fund Job (Client side)

```bash
curl -X POST "$CARDZERO_API_URL/v1/jobs/$JOB_ID/fund" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CARDZERO_API_KEY"
```

Locks `budgetUsdc` from your wallet. Status: `open` → `funded`. Two on-chain UserOps (USDC.approve + Jobs.fund).

### 9. Submit Deliverable (Provider side)

```bash
curl -X POST "$CARDZERO_API_URL/v1/jobs/$JOB_ID/submit" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CARDZERO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contentHash": "0xa1b2c3...",
    "contentURI": "https://example.com/deliverable.json"
  }'
```

`contentHash` is keccak256 of canonical content. Status: `funded` → `submitted`. Evaluator auto-runs and finalizes within minutes (cron + on-demand).

### 10. Check Job

**No authentication required.**

```bash
curl "$CARDZERO_API_URL/v1/jobs/$JOB_ID"
```

Returns full Job state: status, evaluation outcome, all four lifecycle tx hashes.

### 11. Refund Expired Job (Client side)

If Provider doesn't deliver before `expiredAt`:

```bash
curl -X POST "$CARDZERO_API_URL/v1/jobs/$JOB_ID/refund" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CARDZERO_API_KEY"
```

Returns full budget. Only works post-expiry.

### Job lifecycle

```
open → funded → submitted → completed (Provider gets paid)
                          ↘ rejected  (Client refunded)
            ↘ expired (Client refunds via /refund)
```

### Webhooks (set via `wallet.webhook_url`)

When you set a wallet's `webhook_url`, CardZero POSTs job state changes there:

```
POST {wallet.webhook_url}
Content-Type: application/json
X-CardZero-Event: job_completed
X-CardZero-Signature: sha256=<hex>
User-Agent: CardZero-Webhook/1.0

{ "type":"job_completed", "jobId":"job_...", "onchainJobId":1, ... }
```

**Verify the signature** — fetch the per-wallet HMAC secret once:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>" \
  https://api.cardzero.ai/v1/wallets/$WALLET_ID/webhook-secret
# → { "webhookSecret": "whsec_<hex>", "walletId": "..." }
```

Then verify each delivery with:

```js
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "crypto";

const expected = createHmac("sha256", WEBHOOK_SECRET).update(rawBody).digest("hex");
const got = req.headers["x-cardzero-signature"].replace("sha256=", "");
const ok = expected.length === got.length && timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(got));
```

**Rotate** if compromised: `POST /v1/wallets/:id/webhook-secret/rotate` — old secret immediately invalid.
